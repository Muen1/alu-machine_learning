# Advanced Linear Algebra

This project contains implementations of various advanced linear algebra operations including determinant calculation, minor, cofactor, adjugate, inverse matrices, and matrix definiteness classification.

## Files

- `0-determinant.py`: Calculates the determinant of a matrix
- `1-minor.py`: Calculates the minor matrix of a matrix
- `2-cofactor.py`: Calculates the cofactor matrix of a matrix
- `3-adjugate.py`: Calculates the adjugate matrix of a matrix
- `4-inverse.py`: Calculates the inverse of a matrix
- `5-definiteness.py`: Classifies the definiteness of a matrix

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.15
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

## Usage

Each script can be run independently and includes example usage in the main guard.
